# Résumé
## About
This is my responsive Material Design-like Résumé. To create it, I used [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) to build its components.
I am hosting it under [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

You can see it LIVE here: [cezar-carneiro.github.io/resume](https://cezar-carneiro.github.io/resume/).

## Running
You can try running it yourself by following these steps:
1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Clone the repository to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/cezar-carneiro/resume.git`
3. Enter the project's folder: `cd resume`
4. Install the project's dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the "app" by running: `npm start` 
6. If the page doesn't open in your browser automatically, access it in [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)
