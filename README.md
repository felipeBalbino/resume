# Resume
## About
This is my responsive Material Design-like Resume. To create it and build its components, I used [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
I am hosting it under [Amazon S3](https://pages.github.com/).

You can see it LIVE here: [fjbalbino.com](http://fjbalbino.com).

## Running
You can try running it yourself by following these steps:
1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Clone the repository to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/cezar-carneiro/resume.git`
3. Enter the project's folder: `cd resume`
4. Install the project's dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the "app" by running: `npm start` 
6. If the page doesn't open in your browser automatically, access it in [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)
7. If you are a recruiter, hire me.
